The code creates a simple tic-tac-toe game using the Flutter framework.

The main() function creates a TicTacToeApp widget, which is a MaterialApp with a title of "Tic Tac Toe" and a home page of TicTacToeHomePage.

TicTacToeHomePage is a StatefulWidget that creates a _TicTacToeHomePageState object in its createState() method. This state object holds the current state of the game, including the game board and the current player.

The initState() method is called when the state is first created, and it initializes the board and the current player. The _resetBoard() method is used to reset the board and current player to their starting values.

The _playMove() method is called whenever a player taps on a cell on the game board. It updates the board with the current player's move and switches to the next player's turn.

The _buildBoard() method creates the game board UI by creating a 3x3 grid of RaisedButton widgets. Each button displays the current value of the corresponding cell on the game board and calls _playMove() when tapped.

The build() method of _TicTacToeHomePageState returns a Scaffold that contains the game board and a FloatingActionButton to reset the game.
